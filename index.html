          <h4 class ="heading2">Some History</h4>

          <p class ="paragraph" >Freud was a very famous psychologist who studied and created psychoanalysis, which depended a lot on the unconscious of a person and dreams which were also generated by the unconscious according to his theories. In his therapy sessions with his patients he used to use a technique called Free Association where he would have said a particular word, and the patient would need to name the first thing that came to his mind in a short period of time. The surrealists were really interested in Freud's studies and started to generate their art from their unconscious. </p>

          <p class ="paragraph" >Unconscious Realities takes some important factors from both the Surrealists and Freud's studies. The program consists of 2 parts, a small quiz which is timed and a random generated surreal collage. The timed quiz resembles Freud's Free Association technique where an answer needs to be given without a lot of thought. The result is very similar to what the surrealists used to do in their artworks. </p>

          <h4 class ="heading2">Some notes about Unconscious Realities</h4>

          <p class ="paragraph" >- It might take a few minutes for all the data needed for the program to load and work properly. </p>

          <p class ="paragraph" >- When the result appears it might take a few seconds for the background video to load. </p>

          <p class ="paragraph" >- Kindly note that as soon as you click to start, the timed quiz will begin immediately. </p>

          <p class ="paragraph" >- When the result appears, a taskbar will appear after a few seconds which will have three buttons, one will give you information on the result, one will save an image of the result and the other will restart the program. </p>

          <p class ="paragraph" >- The program will automatically restart after 4 minutes. </p>

          <p class ="paragraph" >- If the program is being run on an android device, I would suggest to rotate the screen so the program can run with a larger resolution (program does not work on ios devices). </p>

          <p class ="paragraph2" >- If you would like to try out the program, kindly click on the button below "Unconscious Realities." </p>
